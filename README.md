## Project Description/Outline:

Using information from a Citibike Jersey City May 2023 csv, I created several data visualizations in order to see how people are using the bikes. In addition to allowing users to interact with the data visualizations, A easy-to-follow story is included in the tableau workbook.

## General Analysis

The most popular places where people start and end their rides are around metros, sea terminals, and popular neighborhoods. Most people are subscribers of the Citibike program and take bikes regularly. Peak times are around 8am and 6pm when riders are commuting to and from work. Most people opted for classic bikes over electric bikes. Sunday peak times are all throughout the afternoon, when riders seem to take a bike for fun. 
Based on the created visualizations, I feel confindent in saying that majority of riders are subscribers and take their bikes to and from work. They also connect those rides from bus stations, metro stops, and boats.
